            <div class="content">
                <p>After graduating with <strong>BSc in architecture </strong>and a profound sense of disillusionment i ventured away from elderly adolescence. Repelled by city life and suburban struggles I found myself by the sea. Life ebbs and flows with the tide - we wait on the next swell. A wave approaches. Judging the potential I make a quick decision. No hesitation, position, paddle and slide the board under my feet. As I accelerate down the face I feel the energy, looking down the line a wall of water rises up in front of me. Opportunity! Opportunity for a searing turn, or smooth cut-back, or even a barrel. I fall. Nevermind, another wave will come. The sun will set and rise and more opportunities will come my way. Inevitably …

            <div class="content">
                <p>…. many days and nights at sea, my skin leathered and salty. Not lost, it seems I have found a new world. Alone - I opened my eyes on this wonderful tech world - it’s beautiful!
                    There a wealth of content and learning facilities, but with no guide I feel that I’m staggering through a forest with fresh eyes. Every CSS animation a different flower, every javascript framework a wonderful new animal species. I need an experienced bushman (full stack dev) to show me how to survive. How to get stronger and thrive.

            <div class="content">
                <p>So to whoever finds this message in a bottle, hear my plea. I am a castaway on the shores of a wonderful new land, with no knowledge of safe passage, or the skills to survive. I have pulled enough scraps together to write this message, however I don't know how long I can last without guidance! Everyday I venture into this tech jungle, and wander as though blind. Is this php fruit safe to eat? It looks like it’s been there for quite some time. Perhaps a React raft is what I should build…… PLEASE SEND HELP!!
