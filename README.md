Founders and Coders Application
===============================

### Welcome to my page

First of all I'd like to apologise for my aweful writing.  The "cast-away" messages aren't
to be taken seriously, but I just wanted to do something to stand out from the crowd.

I have incorparated as many bells and whistles into this little page as I could, although 
in truth it's half as many as many as I tried.  Alas, I gave it my best shot, and I have 
still a long road ahead of me to figure out why so much of what I tried did not work.

### Here's a list of some things featured on my page.
--------------------------

- Semi resposive Nav-bar with internal and external links
- responsive layout using flex-box and media queries
- custom cursor on hover over the nessages
- replacement of text on clicking the messages
- a small respensive gallery
- a 'return-to-top' button
- sounds of waves lapping on page load
- stop the audio with key press


## Some of the things still to do
---------------------------------

- a better nav bar with drop-down options
- the image carousel on this page (iframe was playing havoc with layout)
- animations between messages
- links to other projects I have done
